# Python Game #

This is my first stab at building a game with pygame.

The goal is to build an engine while simulatneously building an engine
to work on top of the pygame base engine.

The code is generally split into 4 categories:
* characters - this represents mobs and the playable character
* components - this represents wrapped aspects of pygame
* objects - this represents any type of object in the game
* turf - this represents landscape, background images, etc.

Feel free to fork or use this repo. Eventually I may create a pip package.
